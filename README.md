# House_price_prediction

Key Sections

Data Exploration (EDA):
In-depth exploratory data analysis to understand the features and identify missing values, distributions, and relationships with the target variable, SalePrice.

2.Feature Engineering:
Handling missing values effectively.
Creating new features based on domain knowledge.
Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Dealing with skewed features using transformations like log scaling.

3.Modeling Techniques:
Training multiple machine learning models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation to optimize model performance.
Applying feature selection techniques to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

4.Ensemble Learning:
Using an ensemble of the best-performing models to improve prediction accuracy.

5.Evaluation:
The evaluation metric used is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), which helps compare predicted prices with actual prices.

6.Final Results:
The notebook provides a detailed description of how the top performance ) was achieved by fine-tuning the models and leveraging robust feature engineering.
